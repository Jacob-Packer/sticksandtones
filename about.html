                <h3>Henry and Maria Flurry</h3>
                <p>Maria and Henry Flurry of Stick and Tones have performed in concert
                    halls, schools, libraries, congregations and with orchestras across
                    the United States for two decades. Maria plays percussion: anything
                    you can tap, scrape, or shake (including water!) and melodious
                    percussion like marimba and vibraphone. Henry plays piano and
                    guitar. They compose as well. <br>
                    Together, they delight in harnessing their classical training to study
                    the music of the world and bring it to audiences of all ages.

                <h3>Mission summary - What is their goal?</h3>
                <p>
Due to a much longer and very beautiful story which they would love to share with you in
person, Henry and Maria return to the road with their "Compassion Tour 2023". Successfully
collaborating with congregations in Arizona to raise funds for people in need inspired them to
expand their mission across the West. Foods banks, microloans, and humanitarian efforts in
Ukraine have benefitted from the living blend of congregational communities and the Flurrys&#39;
musical offerings.
