            <h4>What is the Compassion Tour?</h4>
            <p>Would you like to bring more music to your life and community? Let me introduce you to Henry and Maria Flurry -professional musicians touring the western states this summer in an effort to raise funds for the needy by providing a fund-raising opportunity (a concert) for religious congregations. They have successfully toured and performed before, and you can find out more about their past accomplishments, as well as more information about THIS summer's tour on their website: <a href="https://sticksandtones.com">Sticks and Tones Website</a>. 
            Henry and Maria flurry offer the compassion Tour as a way to raise funds for those in need. As they travel across the western states, congregations are able to invite their community to join the musical performances.</p>
