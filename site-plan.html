        <b> Where?</b> <br>
They will perform in the area the best fits your community&#39;s needs whether that be the
Sanctuary, another room, or even outdoors. While an acoustic piano is preferred, they are also
happy to bring their own sound system and keyboard. <br>

<b> Why?</b> <br>
No matter the foundational devotional text, the many congregations the Flurrys have
experienced value supporting those in need. As music ministers to multiple congregations, they
have participated first-hand in the day-to-day operations that tend to limit the volunteer hours
available to mount an effective fund-raiser. Sometimes a congregation has a very important
need in mind that has been waiting to rise to the top of the list of priorities for too long. The
Flurrys hope their offerings provide a call to your congregation to set aside a little time for
themselves to gather in community at a concert and/or children-centered performance to make
the difference they want to see in the world. <br>

<b>What do people say??</b> <br>
From Kellie Walker, Music Minister, Trinity Presbyterian Church, Prescott, AZ: <br>
I am writing to highly recommend Maria and Henry Flurry for a concert in your setting. I have
known them personally and professionally for a number of years, and they are a joy to work with. Maria is a highly accomplished symphonic percussionist and versatile performer. As the
duo “Sticks and Tones” they have presented entertaining, moving, and joyful concerts in school,
church, and community settings. A few months ago I was privileged to hear a new composition
of Maria's in a concert at Yavapai Performing Arts Center with her percussionist trio. Utilizing
bowls of water and a painter who painted live on stage, this piece also combined special lighting
and was truly a wonderful piece of “performance art.” <br>
Both Henry (a pianist, guitarist, and acclaimed composer) and Maria have a refreshing and
engaging manner with audiences of all ages and stages. My church, Trinity Presbyterian in
Prescott, Arizona has frequently hired Maria as a guest musician and she always adds
musicality and depth to my choir Cantatas, as well as simpler pieces such as vocal solos. <br>

<b>Mission summary - What is their goal?</b><br>
Due to a much longer and very beautiful story which they would love to share with you in
person, Henry and Maria return to the road with their "Compassion Tour 2023". Successfully
collaborating with congregations in Arizona to raise funds for people in need inspired them to
expand their mission across the West. Foods banks, microloans, and humanitarian efforts in
Ukraine have benefitted from the living blend of congregational communities and the Flurrys&#39;
musical offerings. <br>
