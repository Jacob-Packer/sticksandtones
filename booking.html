                <p><b>What kind of music does Sticks and Tones offer?</b><br>
                    "From Bach to Blues" for Youth to Seniors Length: 60 or 90 minutes
                    The listener journeys with Henry and Maria from "Ave Maria" and
                    "The Swan" to Spain, India, New Orleans, and even Henry's original
                    composition about dear Jasmine the cat and her antics in the picture
                    window of the Flurrys' living room. <br>
                    "Find Your Voice" for school-age children. Length: About 55 minutes.
                    Our voices have power. We use our voices to share stories, express
                    ourselves, and spark change. Our voices include not only the words we use, but
                    movements we perform and the music we make together. "Find Your Voice" will provide
                    an interactive hour to explore sounds, singing, and creating with the people next to us.
                    As a group, we will write a song celebrating how we can make our voices count as we
                    build a better world. <br></p>
