                <h3>What?</h3>
                <p><b>What kind of music does Sticks and Tones offer?</b><br>

                    The listener journeys with Henry and Maria from "Ave Maria" and
                    "The Swan" to Spain, India, New Orleans, and even Henry's original
                    composition about dear Jasmine the cat and her antics in the picture

                    Our voices have power. We use our voices to share stories, express
                    ourselves, and spark change. Our voices include not only the words we use, but
                    movements we perform and the music we make together. "Find Your Voice" will provide
                    an interactive hour to explore sounds, singing, and creating with the people next to us.
                    As a group, we will write a song celebrating how we can make our voices count as we
                    build a better world. <br></p>
